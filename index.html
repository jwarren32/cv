        <p><em>Web developer in the making</em></p>
        <p>
          My name is Jessica Warren. I have been learning all the basics of web development for about two weeks now. I started going to college at 21 years of age and I obtained an associate degree in Business Technology. It was then that
          I became aware of my interest in computers. I like de-coding puzzles on websites to really figure out how things work. I began working as an administrative assistant after finishing collge but quickly realized that is not where my
          strong suit is. I am computer-savy and I deeply enjoy working on projects with the computer. After considering options of how I could do that for a living, I decided to learn web development.
          I have been using Skillshare and Udemy as resources to learn the basics. I am using this course to learn intermediate level of development. I would love to be a full-stack developer because I know
          that knowledge is incredibly useful.
